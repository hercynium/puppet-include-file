puppet-include-file
===================

This is a puppet module with a function that performs the same kind of
"include" functionality that other languages and config formats enjoy.

This way, you can put chunks of puppet manifest code into files and use
the "include\_file" function from this module to virtually include their
contents at the point in the other file where the function was called.

Docs and a proper module structure Coming Soon(tm)
